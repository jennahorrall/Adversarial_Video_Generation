WARNING:tensorflow:From avg_runner.py:30 in __init__.: __init__ (from tensorflow.python.training.summary_io) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30.
Instructions for updating:
Please switch to tf.summary.FileWriter. The interface and behavior is the same; this is just a rename.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /p/lustre2/kochansk/summer2019/jenna/rescal_gan_model/Adversarial_Video_Generation/Code/d_model.py:92 in define_graph.: scalar_summary (from tensorflow.python.ops.logging_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-11-30.
Instructions for updating:
Please switch to tf.summary.scalar. Note that tf.summary.scalar uses the node name instead of the tag. This means that TensorFlow will automatically de-duplicate summary names based on the scope they are created in. Also, passing a tensor or list of tags to a scalar summary op is no longer supported.
